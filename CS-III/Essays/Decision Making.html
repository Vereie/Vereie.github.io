        <p class="essay">There are a few biases that I believe will be quite impactful in my ISP team's decision making processes. Those being similarity, correlation, imaginability, overconfidence, and selectivity biases.</p>
        <p class="essay">Similarity bias is when, "the likelihood of an event occurring is judged by the degree of similarity with the class it is perceived to belong to." This is something I believe may occur during our planning process as when coming up with functions we may assume that some functions are similar to each other such as movement of the player and the camera, as we could use a camera that stays centered on one of the tiles of the map and moves when the player moves tiles or a camera is centered on the player. In order to avoid this kind of bias I can start thinking about how the functions are different as this will provide another angle to see them from.</p>
        <p class="essay">Imaginability bias is when you can imagine it you believe it to be more feasible. I believe imaginability will be one of the biases that affects us the most, especially myself as we might believe that we understand how the function works, but are missing a key component or underestimate the complexity. To overcome this I plan to research what we plan to add as to see if there are any examples and see if they may be too much for us or may cause other issues when implemented with the pre-existing code.</p>
        <p class="essay">Correlation bias is when the probability of two events occurring together is overestimated as they remembered to have co-occurred in the past. This is  another bias that is quite common and extremely prevalent to our ISP as when making functions in the game we may assume that two separate functions are one leading to the over complication of a function that could be simplified by splitting them. I will be able to overcome this by splitting function concepts into their most simple forms, as combining multiple small functions to make a larger function is much more efficient and better looking than a large function.</p>
        <p class="essay">Overconfidence bias is when the ability to answer difficult or novel questions are overestimated. A common bias that is quite important early on as being overconfident in the beginning planning phase as it could lead to a project that is too grand in scale for us to complete. To overcome this bias I will ask questions that will make us consider whether or not we truly need the feature and whether or not it will be too time consuming.</p>
        <p class="essay">Selectivity bias is when the, "expectation of the nature of an event can bias what information is thought relevant." I believe that this bias is quite prevalent as we all see things differently as we have different experiences and knowledge meaning we may all have different solutions to the problems we encounter. However this bias is the solution to itself, my solution is to just collaborate with my peers as that allows us to get different viewpoints to the problem. To overcome this myself is also possible. It just requires me to put myself in another person's shoes and think how they may think.</p>
        <p class="essay">All the biases will be prevalent in the planning and creation of our ISP and I believe that we will be able to overcome them all through thorough thinking, research, and collaboration.</p>
