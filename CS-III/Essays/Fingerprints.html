      <p>The Internet is a cooperative public data network and is always growing. During this time while you browse on the internet are you truly safe. Are you being watched at this very moment? Is this website truly what it says it is? This is where HTTPS comes into play. With HTTPS websites are given a "fingerprint" a certificate that is unique to every website. Websites used to use HTTP connections as HTTPS was expensive resulting in them to be reserved for websites involving sensitive information. HTTP was not very secure as it was missing the S which stands for secure, so anyone could see what you were doing on the internet. As technology has advanced using HTTPS became cheaper and as a result far more common, this is good for us consumers as that means our data will remain personal and private. However for people wanting to track you this is a problem employers, schools, and others have an increasingly more difficult time monitoring and filtering. The FBI even refers to this as the "Going Dark Problem" thats how you know it's secure and private when even the FBI complains about not being able to access your private information.</p>
      <p>I would say if the government has evidence and a reason to eavesdrop then go ahead do so I have nothing to hide, but if they are eavesdropping for the sake of eavesdropping then they should not be doing so. Schools do have some reasons for eavesdropping on my communications, while I am using their internet, however it is not right to be tracking my communications at my own home on my own internet through the use of google extensions forcefully installed whenever I sign into my school account so that I can do the work assigned that run even when I am on a blank tab. Your internet service provider may have some reason to be eavesdropping on your communications, however ISPS track everything you do this includes private information such as passwords this means whenever a data breach occurs your passwords and other sensitive information could end up in the hands of anyone. The ISPs do a have a reason for tracking your communications though and of course its copyright laws, if an ISP is found to have copyrighted material and fails to remove it they can get in huge trouble for it. </p>
