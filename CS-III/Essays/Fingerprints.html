      <p class="essay">The internet is a cooperative public data network that is always growing. During this time while you browse the internet are you truly safe? Are you being watched at this very moment? Is this website truly what it says it is? This is where HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) comes into play with its private and secure connections. HTTPS also has two other names SSL and TLS ("Secure Sockets Layer" and "Transport Layer Security"). With HTTPS/SSL/TLS your data is encrypted in a way no one knows how to break (Gibson, n.d). With HTTPS websites are given a "fingerprint", a certificate that is unique to every website. How it works is your browser has a list of trusted certificates that are added after a website has gone through verification, and is deemed safe and secure the Certification Authority signs their site's security certificate. Originally websites used HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) connections as HTTPS was expensive resulting in them being reserved for websites involving sensitive information. HTTP was missing the most important letter, "S" which stands for secure, so anyone could see what you were doing on the internet. As technology has advanced, using HTTPS became cheaper and as a result far more widespread. This is good for us consumers as that means our data will remain private and secure. However, for people wanting to track you this is a problem. The government, schools, and others have an increasingly more difficult time monitoring and filtering what you do. The FBI even refers to this as the "Going Dark Problem" that's how you know it's secure and private when even the FBI complains about not being able to access your private information.</p>
      <p class="essay">To combat the increasing use of HTTPS schools, businesses, and others began using HTTPS proxy appliances. HTTPS proxy appliances work by adding a "Pseudo Certificate Authority" to the user's browsers or computers. The reason this works is when opening a site using HTTPS the certificate is sent to the CAs including the pseudo ones. As soon as the user makes a "secure" connection to a site, the SSL Proxy Appliance intercepts the connection and creates a fraudulent certificate to impersonate the intended site which is then signed by the pseudo-CA (Gibson, n.d). This is also known as MITM (man-in-the-middle) attacks as the data is intercepted and possibly altered between the two parties. This could result in the possible theft or leak of private information (Swinhoe, 2022). These SSL interceptions can't be prevented however, they can be reliably detected as it is impossible to completely spoof any security certificate (Gibson, n.d). When examining an SSL certificate you can create a "cryptographic hash" of the certificate's contents. These cryptographic hashes are complex mathematical algorithms that carefully process every bit of information. When one bit inside of a certificate is changed an average of half of the fingerprint hash bits will change in response meaning that any change in a fingerprint result in an entirely different fingerprint (Gibson, n.d).</p>
      <p class="essay">Large companies such as Amazon and Google may deploy multiple different security certificates across their many globally distributed servers and websites. Having multiple certificates can make obtaining and managing them easier while having no reduction in security. So when comparing certificate fingerprints one may be misled into thinking their connections are being intercepted when they are not, this is known as a false-positive (Gibson, n.d). The opposite of a false-positive would be a false-negative which would imply when the fingerprints match despite you being intercepted. </p>
      <p class="essay">Our schools, government, and internet service providers do have a right to eavesdrop on our communications, however, there should be limitations. The government should only be allowed to eavesdrop if they have probable cause to do so or a warrant. This would work similarly to how a police officer needs probable cause or a warrant to search your vehicle. How they get the probable cause to do so is an incredibly dangerous slippery slope though. It would require the internet service providers to report suspicious activity that their client performs, as I believe that government and business should never mix as that leads to the government controlling the narrative. I believe that internet service providers do have the right to eavesdrop on your communications as you are using their services. It can be thought of as the ISPs being your landlord and the internet is the house you are renting from them, the landlord needs to come by and check up on the house to make sure you are not misusing it, this does not mean that they should limit what you see. However, I do believe that ISPs should not be saving data such as passwords or other private information as in the case of a data breach their clients will be at risk. Schools should have the right to eavesdrop on communications while people are using their services, as long as it is to better the learning experience of their students. The caveat is that the school should listen to its students and staff. For example, if the school blocks the use of a website that was being used to better the learning experience of a class, the school should listen and unblock it even if it was being misused by a couple of individuals.</p>
