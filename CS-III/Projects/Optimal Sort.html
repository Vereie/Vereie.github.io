        <p>This is the GitHub page for the Optimal Sort I worked on.<a href="https://github.com/SterbenShell/OptimalSorting">GitHub Page Link</a> The sorting algorithm used was a quick sort which was made using the language Swift. Three other sorting algorithms were used those being insertion sort, selection sort, and bubble sort. I chose quick sort as the algorithm to use as through my research I found it to be on average faster than most other sorting algorithms. </p>
        <h2>Bubble Sort Summary</h2>
        <p>Bubble sort was the slowest of the sorting algorithms tested which was to be expected with its archaic process of sorting. Bubble sort works by comparing the currently selected element with the element that comes after then swapping them if needed, after which it moves to the next element and repeats until it reaches the end where it then starts at the beginning once more and repeats until no swaps are performed during a pass meaning the array is sorted. For such an archaic and tedious way of sorting it is no suprise that it ended up being the slowest of the sorting algorithms.  </p>
        <h2>Selection Sort Summary</h2>
        <p>Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that gets slower as the array gets larger as it only sorts one element per pass. Due to the nature of selection sort no matter if the array is already sorted or not it should take the same amount of time. Selection sort works by going through the array and leaving a marker on the lowest value found during said pass then continuing to find a lower value and moving the marker should it find one. After the it reaches the end of the pass the marked element gets moved to the starting position of a pass and the starting position of the pass is moved forward one and it repeats the starting position is moved the final element of the array meaning the array is sorted.</p>
        <h2>Quick Sort Summary</h2>
        <p>The reason for choosing the quick sort algorithm was that through my research I found it to be one of the faster sorting algorithms on average and according to my data this was found to be correct. When compared to the other sorting algorithms the quick sort was far more efficient by a substantial difference.</p>
