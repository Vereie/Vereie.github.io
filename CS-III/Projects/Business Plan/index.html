        <h1>Problem</h1>
        <p>RTS games have fallen into obscurity throughout the years and they didn't make Warcraft 4.</p>
        <h1>Solution</h1>
        <p>I propose for our ISP we make an RTS game in similar fashion to the Warcraft games and Starcraft using Unity.</p>
        <h1>What we need</h1>
        <p>To make such a game we will need to learn how to use Unity as it is a good engine for doing so, as such we will need to learn how to use the C# language as that is what Unity uses. We will also need to learn a language that will allow us to have an AI to play against as such I believe Python may be able to fulfill this need.</p>
        <h1>Audience</h1>
        <p>Now as for the audience I hope that with a single feature we will revive the RTS genre for the younger masses that being Battle Royale. I hope that through a Battle Royale gamemode we will attract the younger masses while keeping the older masses intrigued with a standard RTS gamemode.</p>
        <h1>Basic Features</h1>
        <p>In this game we will have 2 factions that the player can choose from to play these will be Orcs and Dwarves. The Orcs will be a more primative and barbaric faction while the Dwarves will be a more civilized and technological based faction. We will have the standard RTS gamemode testing the player's microing and macroing skills.</p>
        <h1>Battle Royale Features</h1>
        <p>We will also be featuring the Battle Royale gamemode how it will work is at the start of each match players will click on a map to choose their starting location. This is where they will place their base and 5 basic worker units. Unlike a normal game of RTS there will not be resource harvesting nodes in Battle Royale as the players will need to have a passive source of income, but there will be upgrades your can purchase in order to increase your resource generation and structures to capture that will also increase your resource generation and provide other benefits. As to prevent insane lag on the servers the unit cap will start out small and increase by a set amount for every player knocked out until the last two players remain where the unit cap will be at its normal maximum. </p>
        <h1>Basic Mechanics Prevelant in both modes</h1>
        <p>To eliminate players you must completely wipe out their army and base, to make this process easier and less frustrating when a player loses their main base and fails to build another within a minute all of their units will have a glow effect applied causing them to be visible to everyone through the fog of war, by doing it this way the player exposed will not be exposing other players who are nearby. Fog of war is a mechanic that covers the map with a "fog" (can just be darkened), this fog is there to give the players a lack of certainty when making decisions during a game as it makes the player question whether or not they are prepared to fight the oppenent as they lack the information on how powerful their opponent is.</p>
        <h1>Units</h1>
        <p>Player units can see through the fog of war to varying degrees depending on the units visibility stat, scout units fulfill this niche by having high speed and visibility stats while lacking in damage, health, and defense stats.</p>
