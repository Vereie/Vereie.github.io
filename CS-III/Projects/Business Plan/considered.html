    <h3>Other ISPs I Considered</h3>
    <h2><a id="ISP-Links"href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/william-clymire/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Detect and Deter Drowsiness Detector</a></h2>
    <p>I considered the ISP "Detect and Deter Drowsiness Detector" I decided against joining as I am unsure that my skill set will be of any use on their ISP. A reason I was considering it was that it seems like a fun ISP with a good premise with a great solution to a common problem.</p>
    <h2><a id="ISP-Links"href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/zachary-chandler/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Souls-Like Game</a></h2>
    <p>I considered Zachary Chandler's ISP a souls-like game as I like that genre of games, however I ultimately decided against it as they are a very complicated game to make and it would likely be too hard of a place to start for my first time making a game. </p>
    <h2><a id="ISP-Links"href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/qasem-abdeljaber/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">VPN that works at school</a></h2>
    <p>When I first saw Qasem Abdeljaber's ISP I thought this seems like a very beneficial use to the students at our school considering how many useful things are blocked by IT and the administrators then I remembered. The main problem with this ISP though is legal matters according to the student handbook it is illegal to use VPNs at school so making one for school would likely be illegal too.</p>
    <h2><a id="ISP-Links"href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/soohan-cho/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Goose Simulator</a></h2>
    <p>Again Soohan Cho's idea seems like a very fun and creative idea, however the issue is whether or not it would violate copyright laws which could result in major trouble should that be the case. Also using the Roblox game engine seems like way too much work to me in order to make a knock off that has likely already been made for that reason I am out.</p>
    <h2><a id="ISP-Links"href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/shreya-kumar/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">The Restaurant Picker</a></h2>
    <p>I like this ISP Shreya Kumar and their group came up with it would be more beneficial to not just students but everyone who has trouble picking restaurants such as myself. However I don't believe that I would bring the skills needed to build such an app as I am unable to do make these decisions myself.</p>
    <h2><a id="ISP-Links"href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/kripa-tailor/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Table Booker</a></h2>
    <p>The idea that Kripa Tailor and their group came up with is a brilliant solution to a common problem that people have. So common in fact that most restaurants have already incorporated this solution to their booking services to some extent. The main issue I have with this ISP is that it eliminates the need for bookers at restaurants further removing available jobs.</p>
    <h2><a id="ISP-Links"href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/layne-yarbrough/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Preorder Lunch App</a></h2>
    <p>This is something that the school should have made ages ago back during Covid as it makes the lunch lines far more efficient which is a common problem as you often spend half of lunch waiting in line. The issue I have with it though is how complicated it would be to make such an app as this requires a ton of security and the fact that the app must send and recieve information which I don't believe that we are ready to take on.</p>
    <h2><a id="ISP-Links"href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/helen-giordano/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">AI chatbot</a></h2>
    <p>Anything to do with AI is a fun idea as AI is the future of the world, however AI is a very thing that requires lots of power in order to make them function properly. Through my own experience working with AI I do not believe that we have enough experience to make a good AI as they require an extreme amount of work to make them life-like and understand human emotions.</p>
    <h2><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/caysen-mayo/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Unity Game</a></h2>
    <p>Caysen Mayo and their group have come up with a fun idea that relates to my ISP due to the fact that both use the Unity engine. However I do not believe that we would be able to fulfill the promise of crisp graphics and a thought provoking story to the audience for that reason I have not chosen them.</p>
    <h2><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/christopher-carter/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">2D Rogue-Like Game</a></h2>  
    <p>Christopher Carter's group has come up with an idea I quite enjoy and I do believe would be possbile for people of our skill level to make as last I saw two of my classmates make something similar in nature and they did quite well in doing so. As such I do believe that I have found an ISP that I quite enjoy and believe I have the skills to be of assistance to them</p>
