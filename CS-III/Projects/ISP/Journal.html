            <p>I need to be more frequent with my communications with my team members. I communicated with my team members and got no response.</p>

          <h2>6-Feb-2023</h2>
            <p>An issue I have encountered is when I was testing the game by running it, several files had changes made to them. I will ask my Team members if this is normal.  </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>I forgot to share the presentation with my Team Members as I don't know their last names. As such I will communicate to them using Discord when they are free as to ask them about what their names are so I may share the presentation to them or they share one to me.</p>

          <h2>23-Jan-2023</h2>
            <p>I have one major issue that I have ran into when I first started up the Godot engine. Being I do not have any experience with Godot and find it quite overwhelming as a new user to it.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Communications in our group have been rather lacking as our group chat in Discord is barely touched.</p>

            <p>The biggest challenge I have faced so far is the lack of communication between the rest of my team and I as we are in different class periods. To fix this issue I have sent an email to my fellow team members asking if there was a better form of communications we could use as emails can sometimes get lost in the mountains of spam we recieve. The other issue is going to be the lack of communications I will have during my class period as they likely have another class to be in during my period. I believe that this issue might be pretty easy to solve if we write good simple notes.</p>
