          <h2>3-Apr-2023</h2>
            <p>I need to start working on issues we have in the issues tab in Github as there may be things I can do in there.</p>
            <p>We are partially behind schedule as we have just fixed a few of the bugs on github that we had such as the gnomes pathing.</p>  
            <p>Our group's communication has sort of started back up as we have finally spoken in the Discord group chat, however we never followed up on Sunday with the group call as we seem to have forgotten.</p>
          </box>
        <box id="JournalBox">
          <h2>27-Mar-2023</h2>
            <p>I neglected doing any work on the ISP as such I need to just work on issues in Github and not think of the harm it can cause as we can always revert it.</p>
            <p>Time is moving a lot faster than I anticipated as for some reason I thought there was a month between March and April</p>  
            <p>We have not had any communications I need to ask them what to do when I get the chance to do so. Otherwise I may need to change to another ISP group I would rather not change to another group as I don't believe it would be very beneficial.</p>

          <h2>20-Mar-2023</h2>
            <p>I have not made any significant contributions to the ISP I need to work on some of the many issues on Github we have at the moment as I may be of use there.</p>
            <p>Currently we seem to be moving either on pace or a little behind likely a result of my little contribution.</p>  
            <p>The lack of communication is quite the issue for me as I am shy and don't like being the one to start conversations especially when I feel bad about it. However I should just start talking instead of sitting idly back scared of their responses.</p>

        <box id="JournalBox">
          <h2>13-Mar-2023</h2>
            <p>I have not done any significant commits as such I should find an some issues on github and fix the issues so that I may get credit.</p>
            <p>We are mostly done with the MVP the last I had checked, however my version of an MVP may be different from my other team members idea of a MVP.</p>  
            <p>I have not communicated with my team over the past few weeks. The poor communication is mostly my fault for not trying to to be the one to start the conversation.</p>

          <h2>27-Feb-2023</h2>
            <p>I still need to work on my Python as I am not entirely sure how to write Python as I am still very new to the language. To improve I will need to work on more of the lessons that go over Python.</p>
            <p>I have yet to present the MVP presentation so I should prepare to present it this week. I am also trying to catch up on my missing work this week as it is the last week to submit them.</p>
            <p>As we had not communicated too much we have created two separate presentations and I am unsure of which one I should present. I should ask them which one they believe would be the smarter one to present.</p>

          <h2>20-Feb-2023</h2>
            <p>The little experience I have with the Godot Engine will make it difficult to create a way to transition between levels however I through online guides I believe I should have little issue learning a way to do so.</p>
            <p>We will need to add a way to advance to the next level. As well as add more levels to begin with as we only have the one.</p>
            <p>Communications have been improving we all have access to the presentation and confirmed that we have access to the GitHub repository.</p>

          <h2>13-Feb-2023</h2>
            <p>I encountered a bug which could be called animation canceling as it is the result of the animation reseting. The bug occurs when the player changes directions during the middle of the attack animation which allows the player to attack more often than intended. This can be fixed by changing how the attack animation works when you move.</p>
            <p>Since there has been an issue with our communications I have been unable to keep up with the schedule. I will need to verify where we currently are on the schedule so that I can be brought up to speed.</p>
            <p>I need to be more frequent with my communications with my team members. I communicated with my team members and got a response I hope this will be the start of good communications.</p>

          <h2>6-Feb-2023</h2>
            <p>An issue I have encountered is when I was testing the game by running it, several files had changes made to them. I will ask my Team members if this is normal.</p>
            <p>We are to do the presentation as it is due soon hopefully it will not cause too many conflicts with our schedule, as it was unplanned and could cause a few issues. There shouldn't be an issue though as we will just need to set aside some more time.</p>
            <p>I forgot to share the presentation with my Team Members as I don't know their last names. As such I will communicate to them using Discord when they are free as to ask them about what their names are so I may share the presentation to them or they share one to me.</p>

          <h2>23-Jan-2023</h2>
            <p>I have one major issue that I have ran into when I first started up the Godot engine. Being I do not have any experience with Godot and find it quite overwhelming as a new user to it.</p>
            <p>I need to set up Godot and learn how to use it so that we may get onto the other tasks at hand.</p>
            <p>Communications in our group have been rather lacking as our group chat in Discord is barely touched.</p>

          <h2>16-Jan-2023</h2>
            <p>I need to get better at Python so that I will have an easier time using Godot. I can do so by finishing the lessons we had been using to learn it last semester.</p>
            <p>Still not entirely sure about what I am to do, but by the looks of it I need to get familiar with what we have created so far and make suggestions and what we can add and improve.</p>
            <p>My team members haven't told me very much concerning the project so I am quite in the dark at the moment. Hopefully it improves and they will enlighten me more about the project.</p>

          <h2>9-Jan-2023</h2>
            <p>I had a bit of difficulty downloading Godot at school so I will need to download it when I get home.</p>
            <p>The schedule says I need to download Godot as it is required in order to do any of the other tasks. </p>
            <p>I have recieved a reply from my fellow team members through the email I had sent they gave me access to a Discord group chat. I hope that this will lead to improved communications between us as we are in separate class periods.</p>

          <h2>2-Jan-2023</h2>
            <p>I need to download the Godot engine in order to get started. Once I download it I will need to get familiar with it.</p>
            <p>I do not have access to a schedule of any sort at the moment as such one of my main priorities should be to learn of it.</p>
            <p>The biggest challenge I have faced so far is the lack of communication between the rest of my team and I as we are in different class periods. To fix this issue I have sent an email to my fellow team members asking if there was a better form of communications we could use as emails can sometimes get lost in the mountains of spam we recieve. The other issue is going to be the lack of communications I will have during my class period as they likely have another class to be in during my period. I believe that this issue might be pretty easy to solve if we write good simple notes.</p>
