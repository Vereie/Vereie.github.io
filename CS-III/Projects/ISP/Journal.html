          <h2>20-Feb-2023</h2>
            <p>The little experience I have with the Godot Engine will make it difficult to create a way to transition between levels however I through online guides I believe I should have little issue learning a way to do so.</p>
            <p>We will need to add a way to advance to the next level. As well as add more levels to begin with as we only have the one.</p>
            <p>Communications have been improving we all have access to the presentation and confirmed that we have access to the GitHub repository.</p>

          <h2>13-Feb-2023</h2>
            <p>I encountered a bug which could be called animation canceling as it is the result of the animation reseting. The bug occurs when the player changes directions during the middle of the attack animation which allows the player to attack more often than intended. This can be fixed by changing how the attack animation works when you move.</p>
            <p>Since there has been an issue with our communications I have been unable to keep up with the schedule. I will need to verify where we currently are on the schedule so that I can be brought up to speed.</p>
            <p>I need to be more frequent with my communications with my team members. I communicated with my team members and got a response I hope this will be the start of good communications.</p>

          <h2>6-Feb-2023</h2>
            <p>An issue I have encountered is when I was testing the game by running it, several files had changes made to them. I will ask my Team members if this is normal.  </p>
            <p>We are to do the presentation as it is due soon hopefully it will not cause too many conflicts with our schedule, as it was unplanned and could cause a few issues. There shouldn't be an issue though as we will just need to set aside some more time.</p>
            <p>I forgot to share the presentation with my Team Members as I don't know their last names. As such I will communicate to them using Discord when they are free as to ask them about what their names are so I may share the presentation to them or they share one to me.</p>

          <h2>23-Jan-2023</h2>
            <p>I have one major issue that I have ran into when I first started up the Godot engine. Being I do not have any experience with Godot and find it quite overwhelming as a new user to it.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Communications in our group have been rather lacking as our group chat in Discord is barely touched.</p>

          <h2>9-Jan-2023</h2>
            <p>I had a bit of difficulty donwloading Godot at school so I will need to download it when I get home.</p>
            <p>The schedule says I need to download Godot as it is required in order to do any of the other tasks. </p>
            <p>I have recieved a reply from my fellow team members through the email I had sent they gave me access to a Discord group chat. I hope that this will lead to improved communications between us as we are in separate class periods.</p>

          <h2>2-Jan-2023</h2>
            <p>I need to download the Godot engine in order to get started. Once I donwload it I will need to get familiar with it.</p>
            <p>I do not have access to a schedule of any sort at the moment as such one of my main priorities should be to learn of it.</p>
            <p>The biggest challenge I have faced so far is the lack of communication between the rest of my team and I as we are in different class periods. To fix this issue I have sent an email to my fellow team members asking if there was a better form of communications we could use as emails can sometimes get lost in the mountains of spam we recieve. The other issue is going to be the lack of communications I will have during my class period as they likely have another class to be in during my period. I believe that this issue might be pretty easy to solve if we write good simple notes.</p>
